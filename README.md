## Description

Creating a react website 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Windwos 10 or 11

### Installing

Node.JS or WSL 2 installed 

### Executing program


To install the full React toolchain on WSL, we recommend using create-react-app:

Open a terminal(Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell).

Create a new project folder: mkdir ReactProjects and enter that directory: cd ReactProjects.

Install React using create-react-app, a tool that installs all of the dependencies to build and run a full React.js application:

In powershell run 'npx create-react-app my-app'

This will first ask for your permission to temporarily install create-react-app and it's associated packages. Once completed, change directories into your new app ("my-app" or whatever you've chosen to call it): cd my-app.

npm start

When you're ready to deploy your web app to production, running npm run build will create a build of your app in the "build" folder.
